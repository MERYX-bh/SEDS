    "$ cd <folder_name>\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3. Git Directory (Local Reposotory)\n",

    "``` shell\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 4. Working with commits(Snapshots)\n",

    "Every time a project state is saved (commited), Git stores a reference to that snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A snapshot is identified by SHA-1 hash ( a Long hexadicimal code). Alternativelly, Git assigns references (alias names, e.g.,`\"master\"`) for hashes for readability and fast memorization for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file called `first.py`.\n",
    "2. Tape the `git status` commande to see the staus of the actual branche.\n",
    "   * What is the reference given to this branche?\n",
    "   * Is a commit (snapshot) created yet?\n",
    "   * What is the status of file `first.py`?\n",

    "        *  What is now the status of file `first.py`?\n",

    "   *  Tape the `git commit -m \"first commit\"` commande to create a snapshot.\n",
    "       *  View the branch changing history by taping the commande: `git log`. \n",
    "       *  What is the SHA-1 hash code given to your commit?\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Exploring Commit History by viewing the differences\n",
    "1. Tape the `git diff HEAD~1` commande to explore commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Creating New Branches\n",
    "1. Tape the `git checkout -b \"dev\"` commande to create a new branch called `dev` from the current status of the `master` branch.\n",
    "2. Explore again th log history. Now the current situation is as follows:\n",
    "![New Dev Branch](figures/git-c2-dev.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Recovering Older Commit Version \n",
    "1. Tape the `git reset HEAD~1` commande to restore the older version.\n",
    "2. Explore again th log history. Now the current situation is as follows:\n",
    "![Restore Dev Branch](figures/git-c1-dev.png)\n",
    "3. Alternatively, you may swich to a previous version by taping `git chckout HEAD~1`. This however will result in detaching the HEAD reference from your branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Merging branches\n",
    "1. To merge the actual branche, `dev`, with the `master` branch just tape `git merge master` commande.\n",
    "2. Explore again th log history. The situation now will be as in step 6:\n",
    "![New Dev Branch](figures/git-c2-dev.png)\n",
